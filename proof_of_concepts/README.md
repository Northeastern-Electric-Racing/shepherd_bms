# Proof of Concepts

Here is where the proof of concepts of the boards working is. The files are pretty barebones
in terms of organization but they get the basic functionality of the chips confirmed.

### Goals of a Proof of Concept
 1. Become familiar with the chip/communication/information we need
 2. Get it working
 3. Identify repetitive code and places for optimization/improvement
